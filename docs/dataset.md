# Example Data Set

![Example Data: Colon sample at three levels of increasing magnification]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ColonExampleDataInsets.png)
**Upper:** Pseudocolor image showing 5 channels from a 28-plex (9-cycle) t-CyCIF image of a normal human colon section. Tiles, denoted by the gray grid, overlapped by ~31 pixels (20 Î¼m).  
**Lower right:** Higher magnification view of the area surrounding a single tile showing 7 channels from 4 different cycles to highlight stitching and registration accuracy.   
**Lower left:** Regions of the tile overlap area at full resolution.  
(Note that the antibodies shown in lower panels differ from the upper panel to make structures relevant for the different spatial scales more apparent.)

This primary colon data set is available for download on Synapse [https://dx.doi.org/10.7303/syn25826362](https://dx.doi.org/10.7303/syn25826362).  
This normal colon specimen was acquired from the Cooperative Human Tumor Network (https://www.chtn.org/). 

*Note that the representative images above only depict a subset of the full list of image channels present in the dataset.*
